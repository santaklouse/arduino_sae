The simple activity emulator on Digispark usb board =)
In loop changes chrome and phpstorm windows (and tabs in it) and preses 'CTRL' key many times.

 - mouse and keyboard support; 
 - TrinketHidCombo lib is used (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Trinket-USB)

**for now it works only on mac/linux**

Pins 0 1 2 can be used for changing mode:
 - w/o jumper or closed 0-1: soft mode. just ctrls with random delay.
 - pins 1-2: full mode. randomly changing applications and its windows (phpstorm,chrome and slack supported for now) and scroll content and random ctrls as well.
